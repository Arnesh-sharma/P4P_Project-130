# Archived Data Folder Contents

This folder contains archived data from early-stage testing. 
This data is not relevant to the final project and should be ignored for analysis.

## 25_07_25
Contains old testing data for:
* Electret BeeSpy sensors
* JFET (Vero board) sensors

**Note:** This data is archived because it is not relevant. The Electret BeeSpy data in this folder was collected *before* connections were secured with the RJ45 adapter and is therefore not valid.

## archived_instrumentation_amp_raw_data
Contains raw oscilloscope waveform captures (as .csv and .txt files) of the capacitive sensor with the instrumentation amplifier. This data is not relevant to the final project.

**File Naming Convention:**
The number in the filename (e.g., `inst_15`) indicates the frequency of the 5Vpp sinusoidal test signal used.
* `inst_10`: 10 Hz test signal
* `inst_15`: 15 Hz test signal
* `inst_25`: 25 Hz test signal
* `inst_60`: 60 Hz test signal
* `inst_100`: 100 Hz test signal
* `inst_150`: 150 Hz test signal

## electret stuff
Contains old, invalid data from the Electret BeeSpy sensors.

**Note:** This data was collected *before* securing the sensor connections with the RJ45 adapter and is not valid.
